Regression test for the decision rule.

Every row below is a real measurement, not a guess:

  NATURAL  - the largest blob found in a real frame with no animal in it.
             Any of these that scores a hit is a false positive.
  INJECTED - the same pipeline run on a real frame and its real learned
             background with a synthetic elliptical target added, so the
             geometry is what the detector would actually see.

Sources: Nossob night 24 Aug 2026 (in the handover notes); Nossob and Talamati
daylight 30 Aug 2026, 13:39-14:07 UTC, both cameras watched simultaneously.
